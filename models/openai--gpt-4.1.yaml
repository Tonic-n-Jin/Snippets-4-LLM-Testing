# Model capabilities
capabilities:
  - ultra-long context (1M tokens)
  - code generation (major improvement)
  - instruction following
  - long-form analysis
  - improved attention mechanisms

# Knowledge cutoff
training_data_cutoff: "2024-06"

# Strengths
strengths:
  - Major gains in coding and instruction following
  - 1M token context window
  - 61.7% on Graphwalks (matches o1)
  - Improved attention for long context retrieval
  - Outperforms GPT-4o across the board

# Limitations
limitations:
  - Performance degrades at full 1M context (80% to 50% accuracy)
  - Not a reasoning model (no extended thinking)

# Prompting notes
notes: |
  GPT-4.1 is optimized for coding and long-form tasks.
  Excellent for analyzing large codebases and documents.
  Use for agentic workflows requiring long context but
  not extended reasoning capabilities.
