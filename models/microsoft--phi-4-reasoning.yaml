description: "Microsoft's 14B model optimized for extended reasoning with 32K context"
context_length: 32768
output_length: 8192

# Recommended defaults for this model
# Lower temperature for more focused reasoning
temperature: 0.3
max_tokens: 4096
top_p: 0.95

# Model capabilities
capabilities:
  - extended reasoning chains
  - math reasoning
  - code generation
  - step-by-step problem solving

# Model specifications
parameters_total: 14000000000

# Strengths
strengths:
  - 2x context window vs base Phi-4 (32K)
  - Extended reasoning chain support
  - Strong math and logical reasoning
  - Efficient 14B footprint
  - Open weights (MIT license)

# Limitations
limitations:
  - Slower than base Phi-4 (reasoning overhead)
  - Text-only
  - Limited for creative tasks

# Prompting notes
notes: |
  Phi-4 Reasoning is optimized for tasks requiring
  extended thinking. Use lower temperature for
  analytical tasks. Best for math competitions,
  logic puzzles, and complex problem decomposition.
