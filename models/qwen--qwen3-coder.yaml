# Prompting notes
notes: |
  The model natively supports a context window of 256K tokens, and can be extended up to 1 million tokens using extrapolation techniques like YaRN. Post-training incorporates long-horizon reinforcement learning (Agent RL) for complex problem-solving through multi-step interactions with external tools.
