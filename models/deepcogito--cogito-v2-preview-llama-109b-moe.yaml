description: "An instruction-tuned, hybrid-reasoning Mixture-of-Experts model built\
  \ on Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E. Cogito v2 can answer directly or engage an extended\
  \ \u201Cthinking\u201D phase, with alignment guided by Iterated Distillation & Amplification\
  \ (IDA). It targets coding, STEM, instruction following, and general helpfulness,\
  \ with stronger multilingual, tool-calling, and reasoning performance than size-equivalent\
  \ baselines. The model supports long-context use (up to 10M tokens) and standard\
  \ Transformers workflows. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning`\
  \ `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)"
