# Prompting notes
notes: |
  Models dynamically assess query difficulty and adjust the "thinking" effort, allowing for faster responses on simple tasks and deeper analysis for complex problems. This includes "Instant Mode" for low latency and "Thinking Mode" for deeper reasoning, with an auto-routing system to select the appropriate mode.
