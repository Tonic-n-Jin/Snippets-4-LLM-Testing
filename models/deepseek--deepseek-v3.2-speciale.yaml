description: DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale is a high-compute variant of DeepSeek-V3.2 optimized
  for maximum reasoning and agentic performance. It builds on DeepSeek Sparse Attention
  (DSA) for efficient long-context processing, then scales post-training reinforcement
  learning to push capability beyond the base model. Reported evaluations place Speciale
  ahead of GPT-5 on difficult reasoning workloads, with proficiency comparable to
  Gemini-3.0-Pro, while retaining strong coding and tool-use reliability. Like V3.2,
  it benefits from a large-scale agentic task synthesis pipeline that improves compliance
  and generalization in interactive environments.
