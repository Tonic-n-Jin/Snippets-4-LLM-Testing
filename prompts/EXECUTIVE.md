```
Organizations are accelerating adoption of LLMs to enhance productivity and decision-making. Success depends not just on access to AI, but on establishing safe, scalable, and measurable practices. Here are three priorities worth considering:
1. Protect intellectual property: Ensure LLM access to internal code, data, or documents occurs in controlled environments such as forks, isolated sandboxes, or synthetic datasets. Start small and expand based on proven value.
2. Control cost while maintaining quality: Standardize prompt workflows, leverage automation platforms to route tasks efficiently, and use tiered model strategies so the largest models are used only when necessary.
3. Enable visibility and accountability: Implement monitoring for usage volume, cost, performance, and security. Review metrics often and enforce governance policies with clear ownership and escalation paths.
With thoughtful structure, organizations can innovate confidently without unnecessary risk.
