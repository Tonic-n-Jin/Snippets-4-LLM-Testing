# Principal Data Engineering

> **A curated collection of production-ready code snippets designed for testing and training Large Language Models (LLMs)**


## Purpose

This repository provides a **large code sample** representing real-world data and ML infrastructure patterns. It's designed to:

- **Test LLM understanding** of production-grade code across multiple domains
- **Provide context** for AI assistants working with data engineering, data science, and ML operations
- **Demonstrate common patterns** found in modern data pipelines and ML systems
- **Serve as reference examples** of well-structured, documented code

## Important Notice

⚠️ **This is a general overview, not a comprehensive solution**

This repository offers a **broad sampling** of common patterns and practices across the data lifecycle. It is:

- ✅ Representative of typical workflows and architectural patterns
- ✅ Useful for understanding end-to-end data pipeline possibilities
- ✅ Educational and demonstrative in nature
- ❌ **NOT** a complete production system
- ❌ **NOT** meant to cover every edge case or scenario
- ❌ **NOT** a replacement for domain-specific deep dives

Think of this as a "tour" of data infrastructure possibilities rather than a complete playbook.

## Quick Start

### For Humans

1. **Browse by domain**: Navigate to `Data-Engineering/`, `Data-Science/`, `ML-Ops/`, `Notebooks/`, or `Workflows/`
2. **Check the catalog**: Each directory has a README with a complete listing
3. **Explore snippets**: Files follow the pattern `{domain}-{category}-{subcategory}-{number}-{description}.py`
4. **Try notebooks**: Interactive RL tutorials in `Notebooks/` with step-by-step implementations
5. **Import workflows**: n8n automation templates in `Workflows/` for AI-powered systems
6. **Adapt and learn**: Code is self-contained with comments explaining key concepts

### For AI Assistants

- **Start with**: [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) - Comprehensive guide to codebase structure, conventions, and workflows
- **Find snippets**: Use the naming pattern to locate relevant code
- **Understand context**: Each snippet includes docstrings, type hints, and production patterns

## Code Quality

All snippets demonstrate production-ready practices:

- ✅ **Type hints** for clarity and IDE support
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** with specific exceptions
- ✅ **Logging** with structured messages
- ✅ **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Docstrings** explaining purpose and usage
- ✅ **Production patterns** (rate limiting, session management, validation)

## File Naming Convention

All files follow a systematic naming pattern:

```
{domain}-{category}-{subcategory}-{number}-{description}.{extension}

Examples:
  de-collect-sources-2-robust-api-client-pagination.py
  ds-model-algorithm-1-model-benchmarking-fair-comparison-framework.py
  mlops-deploy-serving-2-real-time-api-with-fastapi.py
```

**Domain prefixes:**
- `de-` = Data Engineering
